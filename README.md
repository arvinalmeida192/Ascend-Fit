## Rank System

50 ranks across 10 tiers, each with 5 divisions (I–V):

| Tier | Color |
|---|---|
| Iron | Gray |
| Bronze | Bronze |
| Silver | Silver |
| Gold | Gold |
| Platinum | White |
| Diamond | Cyan |
| Emerald | Green |
| Ruby | Red |
| Sapphire | Blue |
| Ascendant | Orange |

Points are earned per workout based on total volume, compound exercise count, and exercise variety. Early ranks progress fast — higher ranks require significantly more effort, modelling real strength gains.
